after recovery and no ibuf operations are allowed; this becomes TRUE if
the log record hash table becomes too full, and log records must be merged
to file pages already before the recovery is finished: in this case no
ibuf operations are allowed, as they could modify the pages read in the
buffer pool before the pages have been recovered to the up-to-date state.

TRUE means that recovery is running and no operations on the log files
are allowed yet: the variable name is misleading. */
